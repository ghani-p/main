# pronouns
This is a cool application for managing pronoun sets.

## Prerequisites
```bash
$ npm install -g bower
```
```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
```bash
$ gem install sass
```
```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```
```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
```

## Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pronouns/main pronouns
$ cd pronouns
$ npm install
```

## Running Your Application
After the install process is over, you'll be able to run your application using Grunt, just run grunt default task:

```
$ grunt
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

* explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration, execute grunt as follows:

```bash
$ grunt prod
```

* explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options

## Testing the Application

```bash
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```bash
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```bash
$ grunt test:client
```

## Running application with Gulp

After the install process, you can easily run your project with:

```bash
$ gulp
```
or

```bash
$ gulp default
```

The server is now running on http://localhost:3000 if you are using the default settings. 

### Running Gulp Development Environment

Start the development environment with:

```bash
$ gulp dev
```

### Running in Production mode
To run the application with *production* environment configuration, execute gulp as follows:

```bash
$ gulp prod
```
